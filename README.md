# Customer Churn Prediction Platform

## Description

This project delivers an end-to-end solution for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications sector. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), advanced feature engineering, and machine learning models to identify customers at risk of leaving. The system features a React frontend for data entry and result visualization, a Flask backend for model inference and data management, and a MySQL database for storage. Achieving a good predictive accuracy, this project demonstrates the practical application of data science and full-stack engineering to real-world business challenges.


## Features

+ **EDA & Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, encoding, and feature selection based on exploratory analysis.
+ **Churn Prediction:** Trained ML model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or CatBoost) for predicting churn probability.
+ **User Interface:** React (TypeScript) form for entering customer details and viewing predictions.
+ **API Backend:** Flask server for handling prediction requests and storing results.
+ **Database Integration:** MySQL database for storing customer data and prediction outcomes.
